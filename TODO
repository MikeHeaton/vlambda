DONE
> colour strings (25/11/17)
> distinguish between lambda and define.
> make defines happen alongside executions.
> Have color check happen when renaming, as well as creating.
> Deleting a parent shouldn't delete the children.
  >> Related: option to remove nodes from lambda.
> When adding an arrow into an L'd node, the source/sink should be added to the L too.
> If there's no label on the arrow, it shoudl use the name of the source instead.


Packages:
Elesfn.remove can be found in line ~2500 of cytoscape.js.
The package should /probably/ use
  var elesfn = Element.prototype = Collection.prototype;
and then define/redefine elesfn.foo like in cytoscape.js.
But I'm not exactly sure how packages work, look at another eg.
